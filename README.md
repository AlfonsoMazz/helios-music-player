# üéµ Helios - A Music Player for People Who Love Audio

Helios is a minimalist, quality-focused desktop music player born from frustration with existing platforms. Tired of streaming services not having the music I wanted at the desired quality, and of bloated offline players saturated with useless options and unappealing interfaces, I decided to build my own solution.

This project is for audiophiles, collectors, and anyone who values a clean, fast, and local music experience.

## ‚≠ê Key Features

Helios is designed around three pillars: performance, audio quality, and a seamless user experience, demonstrated by its fluid and responsive interface.

### üöÄ Performance & Library
* **Instantaneous Startup:** Thanks to **persistent caching with IndexedDB**, your library of thousands of songs loads instantly after the first scan.
* **Fluid Interface:** The UI is optimized to handle massive libraries without freezing or slowing down, featuring smooth transitions between views.
* **Local Management:** Full control over your music. Simply add your folder, and Helios handles the rest.

### üéß Playback Experience
* **Advanced Mini-Player:** A floating, independent **"Always On Top"** window that you can place anywhere over your other applications.
    * **Adaptive Dual-Design:** Automatically transforms from a sleek "Bar Mode" to a cover-art-focused "Square Mode" when you resize it.
    * **Perfect Sync:** All controls (play, progress, volume) are synchronized in real-time with the main window.
* **Superior Audio Quality:**
    * **10-Band Graphic Equalizer:** Fine-tune the sound with a real-time pop-up EQ panel powered by the Web Audio API.
    * Support for high-quality formats (`.flac`, `.wav`, `.mp3`, etc.).
* **"Fast Jump" to Current Song:** Instantly navigate to the currently playing track's position in any playlist with a single click on the cover art in the sidebar.
* **Slide-Out Play Queue:** Manage what's next with a dedicated panel that slides smoothly into view. Supports **Drag & Drop** for reordering your upcoming tracks.
* **Error Detection:** If a song is corrupt, Helios will automatically skip it and notify you, keeping your music uninterrupted.

### üé® UI & Customization
* **Polished & Interactive UI:** Experience thoughtful micro-interactions that enhance usability, like hover-to-play buttons appearing on track numbers and album art.
* **Full Session Restore:** Helios remembers everything: the last song you listened to, the exact second, the shuffle/repeat state, and your equalizer settings, providing a seamless continuation of your listening session.
* **Clean, Modern Design:** An interface inspired by the best music apps, but without the clutter. Built with a focus on readability and aesthetics.
