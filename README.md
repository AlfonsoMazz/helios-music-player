# 🎵 Helios Music Player by Almazz

A customizable, offline desktop music player built with modern web technologies. Designed to play local music libraries with a focus on audio quality, a clean interface, and smooth performance, even with massive libraries.


## ✨ Key Features

### Performance & Library Loading
* **Persistent Caching (IndexedDB):** The music library is scanned only once and saved to a browser database, allowing for **near-instant** loading in subsequent sessions.
* **Intelligent Asynchronous Rendering:** The application is optimized to handle thousands of songs without freezing the interface.
    * **Real-time Library Scanning:** During the initial scan, folders and playlists appear in the sidebar one by one with a smooth animation, providing immediate visual feedback.
    * **Instant Playlist Loading (Skeleton UI):** When opening a large playlist, the interface appears **instantly** with placeholders for each song, preventing any lag or frozen screens.
    * **Dual-Stream ("Parallel") Rendering:** Songs are loaded into the list via two simultaneous processes: a top-down cascading render and a priority render that immediately draws the current track and its neighbors, enabling instant navigation.

### Playback & Queue Experience
* **Unified Queue:** The "Up Next" panel displays a complete view of what's coming, combining manually added songs and the "natural" queue generated by the playlist order or shuffle mode.
* **"Next Up" Card:** A preview card in the player bar always shows the next song, offering context about the music flow.
* **Auto-Skip on Error:** The player detects corrupt or unreadable audio files, automatically skips them to avoid interrupting the session, and displays a temporary notification.
* **Advanced Playback Controls:** Shuffle-aware smart play, persistent sorting settings per playlist, and an optimized search using "debouncing".

### Session Persistence & UI
* **Full Session Restoration:** The application remembers and restores everything: the last song, the exact second, the state of the controls (Shuffle, Repeat), EQ settings, and the **visual state of the UI** (expanded folders and sidebar scroll position).
* **Reactive & Coherent UI:** The highlight for the active song and playlist is persistent and synchronized across all views. The design has been refined to ensure legibility and a clean aesthetic.
* **10-Band Graphic Equalizer:** Real-time audio processing via the Web Audio API with adjustable gain per band.

    * **View-Controller** pattern for the main view.
    * Central orchestrator (`main.js`) coordinating all modules.
    * HTML component loading via the **Fetch API**.
* **Data Persistence:**
    * **IndexedDB:** For library caching.
    * **`localStorage`**: For saving settings and session state.
* **Audio Processing:** **Web Audio API**
* **Audio Metadata:** **jsmediatags**
* **UI Optimization:**
    * **Placeholder Rendering (Skeleton UI)** for instant scrolling.
    * Lazy Loading and Asynchronous, dual-stream rendering.
    * **Debouncing** technique for efficient search.
